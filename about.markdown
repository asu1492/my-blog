Hi, I’m Abhishek Singh.

I’ve always been passionate about learning deeply and sharing that knowledge with clarity and purpose. My journey has taken me through diverse paths — from preparing for the Indian Civil Services to building intelligent, scalable software systems in the supply chain domain.

My background in philosophy, history, and governance has shaped the way I think — helping me approach engineering problems with structured reasoning, analytical depth, and an appreciation for systems thinking. I bring the same mindset to software engineering — whether it’s designing resilient APIs with Java and Spring Boot, integrating chatbots using OpenAI or Vertex AI, or developing event-driven systems with RabbitMQ.

This site is my space to share ideas, document what I learn, and hopefully spark curiosity or insight in someone else. Whether it’s a technical deep dive, system design reflection, or productivity experiment, my goal is to make learning visible and useful — to myself, and to others walking similar paths.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you find something valuable here.
